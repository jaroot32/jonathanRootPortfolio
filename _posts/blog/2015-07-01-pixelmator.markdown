Pixelmator is a great program for photo and graphic editing. 

Freepik is an awesome resource for graphic work by amazing graphic artists. The resources I am using in this tutorial are linked at the bottom. 

Start with a set of icons. Be sure to credit whichever artist you chose.

Use the background removal tool to isolate each icon apart from it's background color.


Use the grids under view to help with centering.
