Light and sound are two of the most important components to making great video content. &nbsp; Too often though these variables are overlooked. &nbsp;Many times it is hard to control the environment you're shooting. &nbsp; Using the right tools can help you maneuver tricky environments and enable you to capture the look and sound you're after.

Most DSLRs have a built in light meter that will read the light coming into the lens. &nbsp; Be sure to also take a reading of light reflecting onto the subject, to make sure you set the correct exposure.

I use the light meter pictured here below. &nbsp;

The second most important instrument I would say is an analogue pre-amp. &nbsp;When recording in the field sound can originate from a variety of places and heard at different decibels.

Working hand in hand with a great microphone, a pre-amp will boost your sound source to line level without adding unwanted noise to the signal. &nbsp;A pre-amp helps you to focus on the signal you're looking to capture by also shaping it's tone and increasing the gain.

Lastly, you will also have good material to work with in post-production. &nbsp; With additional mixing and mastering your work will have the potential to sound great.

I use the pre-amp below when shooting indoors.
