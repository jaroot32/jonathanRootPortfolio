Light and sound are two of the most important components to making great video content. &nbsp;&nbsp; Too often though these variables are overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;Many times it is hard to control the environment you're shooting. &nbsp;&nbsp;Using the right tools can help you maneuver tricky environments and enable you to capture the look and sound you're after.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most DSLRs have a built in light meter that will read the light coming into the lens. &nbsp; Be sure to also take a reading of light reflecting onto the subject, to make sure you set the correct exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The second most important instrument I would say is an analogue pre-amp. &nbsp;When recording in the field sound can originate from a variety of places and heard at different decibels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Working hand in hand with a great microphone, a pre-amp will boost your sound source to line level without adding unwanted noise to the signal. &nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-amp helps you to focus on the signal you're looking to capture by also shaping it's tone and increasing the gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Lastly, you will also have good material to work with in post-production. &nbsp; With additional mixing and mastering your work will have the potential to sound great.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I use the pre-amp below when shooting indoors.&nbsp;&nbsp;
