## About: 

### In this exercise I use flexbox for the layout. I am also using JavaScript and jQuery for the menu and bottom navigation link.  I used Codepen to host the site.

### Responsive - breaks down for major tablets & phones

### Flexbox

### Browsers - All modern browsers

###  Specs

#### Make the page responsive

#### Make the first H1 tag to be fixed at the top of the window so it always shows when you scroll down

####  Make the “Back to top” link scroll to the top of the “Back to Most Important Story” module and not to the top of the page.
