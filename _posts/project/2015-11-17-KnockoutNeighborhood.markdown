## Situation:

Udacity final project for the courseware on AJAX and Design Patterns.

## Features:

[KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/)

AJAX calls to [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=en)

[Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

[Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/)

[Normalize CSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)


## Run:

[View on gh-pages](http://jaroot32.github.io/movingApp/)

Download or clone repository and open index.html

## Objective

### Complete the app with the following specification requirements.

#### Interface Design

1) All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner.

2) All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

#### App Functionality

1) The search bar filters both the locations in the list view and the markers on the map.

2) List view shows locations that have been searched for, additionally clicking on a location activates its associated map marker.

3) Map shows each searched location as a marker, each maker can be clicked and shows unique information about a location in an infowindow.  Markers should animate when clicked (e.g. bouncing, color change).

#### App Architecture

1) Code is properly seperated based upon Knockout's best practices (following MVVM pattern,
avoiding updating the DOM manually, using observables rather than forcing refreshes manually, etc).

2) Student hard codes at least 5 locations in their model.

#### Asynchronous Data Usage

1) Application utilizes Google's Map Api and at least one additional third-party "data API."

2) All data requests are retrieved in an asynchronous manner.

3) Data requests that fail are handled using common fallback techniques (i.e. AJAX error or fail methods).

#### Location Details Functionality

1) Functionality providing additional data about a location is provided.

2) Application runs error free.

3) Functionality is presented in a usable and responsive manner.

#### Search Functionality

1) A search function is provided.

2) Search function runs error free.

3) A search function is presented in a usable and responsive manner.

#### List View Functionality

1) A "list view", or some other variation of browsing the content (beyond search/map) is provided.

2) List view functionality runs error free.

3) A "list view", or some other variation of browsing the content (beyond search/map) is presented in a usable and responsive manner.

#### Code Quality

1) Code is ready for personal review and neatly formatted.

#### Comments

1) Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.

#### Documentation

1) A README file is included detailing all steps required to run the application.
