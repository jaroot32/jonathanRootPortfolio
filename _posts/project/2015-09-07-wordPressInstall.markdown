##Ubuntu 14.04 via a Digital Ocean Droplet

###*Neighborhood Place of Puna

Some clients already have a theme in mind and just need to get up and running. In this situation I figure it best to configure the server and let the client have the keys.

Just add a theme and content and have your domain point at your new servers.


*Neighborhood Place of Puna (NPP) is a not for profit organization in Keaau, HI. NPPis a Home Visiting Family Strengthening program. NPP is the only program offering free and voluntary intensive (weekly), on-going, in-home services to families with children ranging in age from 0 to 17.
