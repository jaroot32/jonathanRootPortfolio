## PRWeb Ghost Writer

While serving as volunteer executive director for a dermatology non-profit, I made the suggestion to start a PRWeb program. I ghost wrote for the organization's lead dermatologist and president.

The three graph images are PRWeb "insights-report" comparing four articles on traffic (impressions), interactions, and full-page reads.  As a result, the organization saw unprecedented amounts of web traffic, user sign-ups, and overall growth.
