##About:

###WordPress Bootstrap 3 w/Modern Front-end Development Workflow

###Responsive - breaks down for major tablets & phones

###WordPress CMS - Site uses WordPress CMS as a backend and can be updated by site admins.

###Bootstrap 3

###Browsers - All modern browsers

#### For this website I used a modern Front-end Development kit called [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/).  Sage uses Bootstrap, Gulp, Sass, and Bower for package dependencies.  I used Vagrant as my local environment with a package called Trellis.  Both Sage and Trellis are part of Roots. Roots strives to keep up with a modern front-end workflow, open source tools, and a lean backend by employing DRY programming principles wherever possible.

####Overall, I was able to preserve an archive of over 100 pages and several hundred photos. 

###Dishes By Doe is part of the Doe Fund and for the past 30 years has provided a hand up, not a hand out to formerly homeless and incarcerated men.
