		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			Dishes By Doe is part of the Doe Fund and for the past 30 years has provided a hand up, not a hand out to formerly homeless and incarcerated men.
		</p>
		<h3>WordPress Bootstrap 3</h3>
		<h3>Responsive</h3>
		<p>breaks down for major tablets & phones</p>
		<h3>Content Management System</h3>
		<p>The site uses WordPress CMS as a backend and can be updated by site admins.</p>
		<h3>Layout</h3>
		<p>Bootstrap 3</p>
		<h3> Compatibility</h3>
		<p>Works on all modern browsers</p>
		<p>
			This website uses a modern Front-end Development kit called <a href="https://roots.io/sage/">Sage</a>.  Sage uses Bootstrap, Gulp, Sass, and Bower for package dependencies.  I used Vagrant as my local environment with a package called Trellis.  Both Sage and Trellis are part of Roots. Roots strives to keep up with a modern front-end workflow, open source tools, and a lean backend by employing DRY programming principles wherever possible.

			Overall, I was able to preserve an archive of over 100 pages and several hundred photos.
