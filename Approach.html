	<h2>Strategy Session with the Client </h2>
	<p>Every client is different in terms of goals and past productions.  In my experience, clients do best when they have a firm understanding of their history, mission, and goals. </p>
	<h2>Research</h2>
	<p>Upon understanding the client it is a good idea to also gain a deeper understanding of the marketplace and audience the client serves.  Based on this information, features and campaigns can be built around the best way to reach and keep the audience, as well as, find new markets that may have been previously undiscovered.</p>
	<h2>Site Audit</h2>
	<p>There are many technical improvements that can be operated on a site to instantly change perception in terms of site speed and responsiveness. A site audit will help to uncover areas that can be fixed.</p>
	<h2>Wireframe</h2>
	<p>A paper and pencil can go a long way in fleshing out ideas for layout and functionality.</p>
	<h2>Development</h2>
	<p>Test and iterate.</p>
	<h2>Production</h2>
	<p>While the code is in production it will need to be updated and maintained.</p>
